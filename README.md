# Datadog Agent

Datadog helps capture various traces and metrics that can help improve the performance of applications. A single Datadog agent is needed for capturing the data of any number of services.

Make sure the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable is available at runtime so that the agent can relay information to the Datadog servers.
